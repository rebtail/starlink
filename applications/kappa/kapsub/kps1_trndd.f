      SUBROUTINE KPS1_TRNDD( FD, NELM, ARRAY, STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     KPS1_TRNDx
 
*  Purpose:
*     Reads a formatted ASCII file who records comprise data values
*     and stores in an array.
 
*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77
 
*  Invocation:
*     CALL KPS1_TRNDx( FD, NELM, ARRAY, STATUS )
 
*  Description:
*     This routine reads records from an ASCII file comprising data
*     values that are to be read into an array, usually for storage in
*     a standard form.  The records in the file may contain comments,
*     either whole lines or at the end of lines.  A comment is
*     recognised by the ! or # which starts it.  The values in the
*     record (less any comment) are converted to the required data type.
 
*  Arguments:
*     FD = INTEGER (Given)
*        Descriptor for the ASCII file containing records of numeric
*        values.
*     NELM = INTEGER (Given)
*        Dimension of the array to be filled with values from the file.
*     ARRAY( NELM ) = ? (Returned)
*        The array to be filled with values from the ASCII file.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.
 
*  Notes:
*     -  There is a routine for integer and floating-point data types:
*        replace "x" in the routine name by I, D, or R as appropriate.
*     -  A warning is reported if the shape does not use all the data
*     points in the file.
 
*  Prior Requirements:
*     - The file must have already been opened and should be rewound.
